**There is a 64k byte size limit to files that can be created by debug.exe**

**To send nc.exe from kali to windows:**

**Use PE compression tool such as upx to compress files.**
Run the following command in kali to compress file:

locate nc.exe | grep binaries
cp [[/usr/share/windoes-binaries/nc.exe]]
ls -l nc.exe
upx -9 nc.exe
ls -l nc.exe

**Now convert the exe file to txt file. Run the following command in kali:**

wine exe2bat.exe nc.exe nc.txt
head nc.txt
